T-2 charged melee weapons are structurally similar to GMS’s T-1 melee weapons, though built with different materials to tolerate the intense heat generated by their projected plasma sheaths. These sheaths can be toggled on or off, depending on the needs of the pilot. GMS’s T-2 energy weapons, like their T-1 kinetics, are sturdy tools with predictable power scaling, minimal particle scattering, and consistent performance ranges.

Consuming a can of Devil! Black allows you to reroll all pilot skill checks involving physical exertion or violence, such as Applying Fists to Faces, Assault, or Get Somewhere Quickly for the rest of the scene, though you must always take the second result. Afterwards, for the rest of the mission the GM may invoke the subsequent harsh comedown to apply +1 Difficulty to any skill checks which might be negatively impacted by aftereffects such as fatigue, jitteriness, irritability, and so on. Drinking more than one can between full repairs causes intense nausea, headaches, heart palpitations, and vomiting, without any further beneficial effects. Chandrasekhar & Herschel reminds all license holders to please consume responsibly.",
