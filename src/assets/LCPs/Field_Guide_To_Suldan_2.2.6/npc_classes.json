            "flavor": "The Titan is less an example of practical military doctrine in action and more a symbol, designed to strike fear in the hearts of enemies and inspire allies as it slowly strides across the battlefield. Towering over even dedicated siege chassis, typically (though not always) quadra- or hexapedal in design, and bristling with heavy weapons and sturdy armor, the Titan's sheer size is a weapon in its own right, but its cumbersome nature and exorbitant costs lead many commanders to view it as little more than an impractical \"wonder weapon\" built to impress generals and stroke the egos of politicians. Nonetheless, combat data recordings from sorties in which Titan class platforms are deployed frequently report anomalously high enemy force depletion percentages across all theaters.",
            "tactics": "The Titan is a towering superheavy artillery walker whose sheer size and implacability make it an ideal choice for dramatic setpiece encounters. The Fire-Linked Batteries have a small dead zone around the Titan which PCs can seek to exploit, but this risks putting them in a position where the Titan can quite literally walk all over them with Unstoppable Force. An important thing to note about the Titan is its Secondary Damage trait, which interacts uniquely with many of its weapons and systems, altering the battlefield or affecting its function in numerous ways. As a result this NPC can require a bit more overhead to run than other classes, and it might be a bit more powerful out of the gate compared to some other NPCs. Care should be taken when building encounters featuring a Titan not to overburden yourself with too many moving parts to keep track of."

            "flavor": "The Valkyrie doctrine is an unusual hybridization of several extant chassis designations created to fulfill a unique battlefield role, that of a fast-moving and maneuverable aerial close-combat platform. Meant to bypass entrenched frontline defenses and seek out high-value targets such as artillery units, field commanders, and electronic warfare platforms, Valkyries engage the enemy with rapid hit-and-run strikes to disorient and overwhelm them. The demanding engineering requirements of designing frames suitable for advanced flight as well as melee combat have kept the Valkyrie from seeing widespread deployment, routinely leading assigned pilots to form close-knit and exclusive circles within more traditional military hierarchies.",
            "tactics": "The Valkyrie is a high-mobility melee attacker well suited to hit-and-run tactics. Hover flight and a generous Threat on its Nanocarbon Partizan allow it to skirt around frontline defenders without running afoul of engagement or reactions, then by using Flyby Strike it can freely attack and reposition, setting itself up for future attacks and pulling the PCs' attention in multiple directions. If the Valkyrie can be grounded then its combat effectiveness greatly diminishes.."
