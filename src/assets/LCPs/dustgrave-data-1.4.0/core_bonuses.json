    "effect": "If your mech has fewer than 3 mounts (excluding integrated mounts) it gains an additional superheavy mount. It can only take SUPERHEAVY WEAPONS. They still require an additional mount to be installed. If your mech also has a heavy mount the SUPERHEAVY WEAPON must use that mount as the additional mount.",
    "description": "Youâ€™d be surprised how large a gun you could fit on a chassis if you ripped out peripheral systems and failsafe redundancies."
